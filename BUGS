f = fixed, r = reopened

[f] animations don't work
[ ] animations cease to play when the scale becomes ridiculously huge
    hardly a problem since you'd never scale a gif to 5000x5000 too often
[ ] gif loading is horrifically slow, problem is gif_main_loop (), takes forever to run for some reason
    only happens with big hueg gifs though.
[f] ugly spastic blank flashing when redrawing the image, very evident in gifs, caused by rapid redrawing of a background image or even just rapid clearing of the window
[f] leftovers of the image when scaling down without touching the window
[f] leftovers present with transparent gifs as they animate
[f] images do not scale while or immediately after loading
[ ] images do not scale while loading
[f] images do not progressively show up as they are loaded (see bug 4)
[f] juggling with references, causing some strange errors
[ ] unfreed memory obvious with enormous gif images, loading another image shows obvious leftovers in memory
[ ] images are not centered
[f] fit-to-window is broked
[ ] fit-to-window infinite loops during size allocate
[f] commandline filepath arguments break thumbnail loading (trailing slash, relative paths)
[ ] segfault when removing an image half-way through loading or when the imagelist is empty (same bug probably)
[ ] flash of some garbage data when flipping through images
[ ] (monocle:30680): Gtk-WARNING **: gtktreemodel.c:2117: bad row reference, proxy has no outstanding row references <- ???
[ ] segfault occasionally probably because of threading
[ ] while testing ran into deadlocks in gdb, couldn't reproduce outside of gdb though
