f = fixed

[f] animations don't work
[ ] animations cease to play when the scale becomes ridiculously huge
    hardly a problem since you'd never scale a gif to 5000x5000 too often
[ ] gif loading is horrifically slow, problem is gif_main_loop (), takes forever to run for some reason
    only happens with big hueg gifs though.
[ ] ugly spastic blank flashing when redrawing the image, very evident in gifs
[ ] leftovers of the image when scaling down without touching the window
