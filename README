Monocle views images.
no silly editing tools no background setting things just view images.
possibly tools to make your image browsing experience more pleasurable.
use GTK for user interface for consistency

Goals:
    Asynchronosity, no gooey freezing up when loading or scaling big hueg image
    "Just Works"
    Lean as in Pocket

License:
    see LICENSE for monocle code license
    see md5.c for the license to the code that does the md5summing

Compiling:
    lignucks:
        make
        there is no step 2
    windowez [not supported yet]:
        get mingw
        edit config.mk to point to the proper mingw dir
        make
        try to run it and realize there is no support for Thumbs.db

Usage:
    monocle [options] [file or folder]
    options are as follows:
        -s (scale)  | sets image scale
        -R          | recursively loads folder if specified
        -v          | version info
        -h          | prints help message

    files are added to a list of images to be viewed as oppose to viewing a folder or bunch at a time
    the add button is broken, click remove to remove an image from the list (one at a time) 

Quirks (aka unfixed things that aren't quite bugs):
    "Open Folder" will try to load the whole folder, images or not
