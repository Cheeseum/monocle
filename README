Monocle views images.
no silly editing tools no background setting things just view images.
possibly tools to make your image browsing experience more pleasurable.
use GTK for user interface for consistency

Goals:
    Asynchronosity, no gooey freezing up when loading or scaling big hueg image
    "Just Works"
    Lean

Compiling:
    lignucks:
        make
        there is no step 2
    windowez:
        get mingw
        edit config.mk to point to the proper mingw dir
        make

Usage:
    monocle [options] [/path/to/image/file]
    options are as follows:
        -s (scale)  | sets image scale
        -R (folder) | recursively loads files from folder (not working)
        -v          | version info
        -h          | prints help message

Quirks (aka unfixed things that aren't quite bugs):
    "Open Folder" will try to load the whole folder, images or not
    Thumbnails aren't generated, only pre-generated ones are loaded
